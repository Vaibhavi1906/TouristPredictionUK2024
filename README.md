# Advanced Predictive Models for Analyzing Tourist Spending Patterns in the UK

**Project Overview**  
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting international tourist spending patterns in the UK. Using advanced machine learning techniques—Random Forest and Gradient Boosting—this study provides insights into factors influencing tourist expenditures. By examining data from 2019-2023, it offers valuable predictions to optimize tourism strategies and enhance economic impacts.

## Key Objectives
- **Trend Analysis**: Examine how spending patterns have evolved over time and identify key determinants.
- **Modeling & Prediction**: Develop and compare Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models for predictive accuracy.
- **Insights for Stakeholders**: Provide actionable insights to support strategic decisions in tourism services and policy-making.

## Project Structure
- **Data**: Historical data on UK tourism (2019-2023), segmented by visitor region and purpose.
- **Models**: Implementations of Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for accurate spending predictions.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics including RMSE, MAE, and R-squared to assess model effectiveness.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and normalization.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial insights on seasonal trends, spending patterns, and tourist demographics.
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Optimizing parameters for best performance on prediction metrics.

## Results
The analysis reveals significant seasonal and demographic trends in tourist spending, with Gradient Boosting outperforming Random Forest in predictive accuracy.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas & Scikit-Learn**: Data manipulation and modeling.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization.
